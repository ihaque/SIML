.. _Setup:

Installing pySIML
=================

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

* pySIML requires a working Python installation, since it is a collection of Python
  bindings. It has been successfully tested on Python 2.4 and 2.5 on both Linux and
  Mac OS X. It also requires that the development header files for the Python
  interpreter used be installed on the machine (e.g., on Ubuntu Linux, package
  ``python-dev`` must be installed, not just ``python``).

* The `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ package, and its headers, must also be
  installed. pySIML makes extensive use of NumPy to store input and output data
  for the SIML algorithm.

* An `OpenMP <http://openmp.org>`_-capable compiler is required to take advantage
  of multiple CPUs (parallel computations over multiple rows of a Tanimoto matrix
  in :ref:`CPULingo <CPULingo>`). 

* `PyCUDA <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda>`_ version 0.94 or greater is
  required for NVIDIA GPU support using :ref:`GPULingo <GPULingo>`. Versions 0.93 and
  previous will not work properly! Note that at the time of this writing, 0.93 is the 
  most recent release version. If this is still true, then you must retrieve a copy of 
  the PyCUDA source code from the source repository (following the directions given on 
  the PyCUDA homepage).

* `PyOpenCL <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl>`_ is required for NVIDIA/AMD
  GPU support using :ref:`OCLLingo <OCLLingo>`.
  

---------------
Setup Procedure
---------------

pySIML is distributed as a source tarball using a mostly-standard Python distutils-based
setup procedure. After untarring the package, most people should be able to run::
  
  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

In some cases, the setup script will not be able to detect one or more settings properly,
in which case, the configure option can be used::

  python setup.py configure <options>

The following options are available:

  * ``--enable-openmp``: Force pySIML to be built with OpenMP support.
  * ``--disable-openmp``: Force pySIML to be built without OpenMP support.
  * ``--numpy-include=<dir>``: Indicates that the C headers for numpy can be found
    in <dir>. Note that if, for example, ``arrayobject.h`` is in ``/usr/include/python2.5/numpy/arrayobject.h``,
    <dir> should be specified as ``/usr/include/python2.5``, NOT ``/usr/include/python2.5/numpy``.
  * ``--python-include=<dir>``: Indicates that the C headers for Python (e.g., ``Python.h``)
    can be found in <dir>.
