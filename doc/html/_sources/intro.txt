Introduction to pySIML
======================

pySIML gives you easy access to SIML, an extremely fast method for computing
LINGO chemical similarities [Vidal05]_. There are existing implementations of
LINGO, such as that included in OpenEye's OEChem toolkit - so why bother with
SIML?

**Speed.**

For several classes of important problems, SIML is significantly faster than
existing implementations of LINGOs. In particular, for M x N similarity problems,
in which one needs to compare every molecule in a set of size M against every other
molecule in a set of size N (and M and N are reasonably large, on the order of
hundreds), SIML on a single-core CPU is several times as fast as existing implementations
of LINGO. SIML also supports computing LINGOs on a CUDA-capable GPU, which allows over
eightyfold speedup relative to even fast CPUs.
